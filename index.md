# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

  This Course Electrical Machines-II, is offered as an integrated course having theory and practice that gives hands-on training adequately supported by required hardware. It deals with Synchronous Machines, single phase motors and Transformers, where students will learn about their construction, operation and testing. The types and characteristics, testing methods will also be discussed. The performance of these electrical machines will be verified by conducting various experiments in the laboratory. 

## <a name="outcomes">Course Outcomes</a>

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment
that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no
partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal
circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and
exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
